# jumping sampler

For this sampling assignment, I decided I wanted to create something playful and relaxing. I drew inspiration from some indie games and decided to create a simple platformer where a small character would jump on different blocks to trigger some samples, while listening to a background base loop.

TL;DR: here you can follow the links to [the sketch](https://nicolaspe.github.io/itp_codeofmusic/code/jumpingsampler.html) or [the code](https://github.com/nicolaspe/itp_codeofmusic/tree/master/code)


My initial idea was creating a cute pixelated character who would jump from platform to platform triggering diverse samples while traversing different backgrounds and base loops. Of course, this was a very ambitious idea that had to be simplified for a week's work. So, I created some "floating" platforms (simply by adding a sine function linked to the number of the platform and the `frameCount`) and a small circular non-animated "character". The backgrounds are simple colors, but I spent some time defining a pastel color palette to give the relaxing feel.


One of the aspects that took me a while and that I'm still not entirely happy with, is the samples I chose. Not all of them match the loops, and while it is not a bad thing (as I wanted to have "good" and "bad" blocks), I still think some of them can me a better match. I got all my loops from [soundpacks.com](https://soundpacks.com) (and used the ones with a free license).
